//This is very basic example of a twitter bot using NodeJS and twit package.

I have 2 files (currently), one for get botget.js and one for post request botpost.js

============================================

botget.js is currently set to search for term 'oneplus' and display top 5 results from it. 

//The search term and the count can be modified easily to search whatever you want.

=============================================

botpost.js is set to tweet 'Back to twitter ' concatenated with a number (just so that each tweet is unique) every 20 seconds.

//Again the variable txt can be modified to tweet whatever you wish. Just make sure that no two tweets is exactly the same or you will get an error.

============================================

The file package.json is the configuration file for node.js and the file config.js contains the keys for authentication.
